# Golang Call Maps

A dynamic tool for generating call graphs from Golang binaries to assist in Golang binary analysis.

## Overview

This repository provides tools and methodologies for dynamically generating call maps from compiled Golang binaries. The initial data and call graph design concepts are inspired by and built upon the foundation laid by [Ghidra_GolangAnalyzerExtension](https://github.com/mooncat-greenpy/Ghidra_GolangAnalyzerExtension).

This project aims to leverage modern infrastructure for automation and provide more timely and flexible tracking of new Golang versions.

## Features

- Dynamic call graph generation from Golang binaries
- Assisted binary analysis for reverse engineering
- Automated processing pipeline
- Support for multiple Golang versions
- Flexible mapping of function calls and relationships

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to enhance the analysis of Golang binaries by:

1. Providing comprehensive call maps that illustrate the relationships between functions
2. Supporting reverse engineering efforts through clear visualization of program flow
3. Automating the analysis process to handle modern Golang binaries efficiently
4. Maintaining up-to-date support for new Golang language features and compiler changes

## Foundation

This work builds upon the excellent research and implementation found in the Ghidra_GolangAnalyzerExtension project, extending and automating the concepts for broader use cases and more current Golang versions.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be provided as the project develops. The tool is designed to integrate with existing reverse engineering workflows and binary analysis pipelines.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome as this project continues to evolve. Please ensure that any contributions align with the project's goals of enhancing Golang binary analysis capabilities.
